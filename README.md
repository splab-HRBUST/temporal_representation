# 02_DTR  
  Language identification (LID) is a key component in downstream tasks. Recently, the self-supervised speech representation learned by Wav2Vec 2.0 (W2V2) has been demonstrated to be very effective for various speech-related tasks. In LID, it is commonly used as a feature extractor for frame-level feature extraction. However, there is currently no effective method for extracting temporal information from frame-level features to enhance the performance of LID systems. To deal with this issue, we propose a LID framework based on deep temporal representation (DTR) learning.
